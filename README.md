# BuildOn

# A container-based Continuous Integration (CI) solution that creates build infrastructure on-demand

It is a time consuming and laborious process to create an ecosystem to run CI with Jenkins. This involves various activities which include setting up of software, hardware, configuring Jenkins masters and slaves, analysis and installation of the necessary softwareâ€™s, installing plug-ins, and providing accesses to different users. 

The Jenkins ecosystem has low infrastructure utilization, limited ability to manage numerous plug-ins needed for technologies and limited scalability of build infrastructure. As a result, developers wait in long queues for committing build codes. UI based Jenkins build configurations increase vulnerability of the pipeline to any code changes. These factors increase the time-to-market and costs of CI while using Jenkins. 

BuildOn, based on Docker, Jenkins and Kubernetes, creates build infrastructure on-demand using virtualization and container technologies. In turn, BuildOn fast-tracks CI set-up, reduces consumption of infrastructure and provides unlimited scalability of build infrastructure. BuildOn supports technologies built on Linux.
